A charge lasts 2 to3 weeks.\u2022 It has 3 flexible shaving elements/blades. Two of these are foils, and in the centre, there is a cutter that aims to cut hair that grows in various directions and lift up other hairs to be cut.\u2022 Wet & Dry\u2013 The Flex Head series is fully waterproof and can be used to shave either wet or dry. You can shave with shaving, cream, soap or foam. (I believe that my series 8 stopped working because I accidentally submerged it in water) this Series 7 claims to be 100% waterproof\u2022 Light Indicators \u2013 A cleaning light will indicate after using the shaver. A red cord indicator comes on when a user tries to use the shaver when it is plugged in and another red padlock indicator comes on after holding the button (also bleeps) for a few seconds to activate the travel safety switch. There is also battery life and foil cassette indicator (which lets a user know when to replace \u2013 every 18 months).\u2022 This series 7 has an extra button underneath the power on/off button. When pressed it indicates the battery charge and if the foil cassette needs replacing without switching the shaver on.I am very impressed with this shaver.

All you get are goofy little graphics.  Use your words Braun.  It's not that difficult.  Yes, you will need some translations.  Deal with it.A good example of how lacking the documentation is: One picture shows a drop from a small bottle being applied to fingertip then to shaving head.  There is no such small bottle in the box, nor any explanation of what it might be.  So I have to email Braun, find out that this is \"light machine oil\", then go and buy some of that, as doing this maintenance step weekly is apparently important.  I guess if the bottle of oil was included I could've figured things out, but lacking that and any kind of explanation led me to do way too much work to properly understand what was required for my shaver.So a 4/5 for the shaving experience, but a 0 for the customer experience.", "title": "Horrible documentation", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on October 4, 2020", "verified": true, "rating": "2.0"},
